# Deploying a Scalable ML Pipeline with FastAPI

This project demonstrates how to deploy a scalable machine learning (ML) pipeline using FastAPI. The project involves data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and deployment of a RESTful API to perform inference with the trained model.

## Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the repository:**
   sh
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Deploying-a-Scalable-ML-Pipeline-with-FastAPI.git
   cd Deploying-a-Scalable-ML-Pipeline-with-FastAPI
## Create and activate the Conda environment:


conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate fastapi
Install Jupyter Lab (optional, if you want to use Jupyter for experiments):


conda install -c conda-forge jupyterlab
Install other dependencies:


pip install -r requirements.txt
Running the Application

## Train the Model:
python train_model.py

## Start the FastAPI server:
uvicorn main:app --reload

## Interact with the API:
Use the local_api.py script to test the API endpoints.

## API Endpoints
GET /
Returns a welcome message.

POST /inference/
Performs model inference.

pytest test_ml.py -v
Model Card
Model Details
This model predicts whether an individual's income exceeds $50K/yr based on census data.

## Intended Use
The model is intended for educational purposes and should not be used for production without further validation and testing.

## Training Data
The model is trained on the census data from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.

## Evaluation Data
The model is evaluated on a subset of the training data.

## Metrics
Precision: 0.7419
Recall: 0.6384
F1-Score: 0.6863

## Ethical Considerations
The model may inherit biases present in the training data.
It should not be used for making critical decisions without proper evaluation and adjustment for fairness.
Caveats and Recommendations
Ensure the data used for training and inference is preprocessed consistently.
Further tuning and validation are necessary for deployment in production environments.
